BUILD â€” How to Build and Run the Interpreter

Requirements:
-------------
- Python 3.x installed on the system.
- No additional libraries are needed.

Build Instructions:
-------------------
There is no formal build process as this is a Python script.

To run the interpreter:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder with Interpreter.py and your test input file (e.g., demo_mixed.txt).
3. Run the following command:

   python Interpreter.py demo_mixed.txt

This will execute the interpreter and print the results of each statement in the input file.

Notes:
------
- Ensure your input file contains only supported syntax from Stages 1 to 4.
- Use one statement per line.
- Do not use parentheses with `print` (e.g., use `print x`, not `print(x)`).
